# Decentralized-Multi-Agent-Drone-Swarm-Framework-for-LiDAR-Based-Exploration-and-Mapping
Autonomous drone swarm in Microsoft AirSim for 3D mapping using LiDAR. Scout drones detect perimeters, mapper drones create layered maps with wall-following and BFS-inspired exploration. Data is fused into global NED coordinates, enabling decentralized, efficient mapping for real-world applications.
